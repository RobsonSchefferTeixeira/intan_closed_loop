Closed-Loop Theta Power Detection (Intan Modification)

Overview
This project involved heavy modification of Intan's software to implement a closed-loop experiment triggered by real-time theta power detection in neural signals. The system was designed to deliver stimuli or interventions based on live physiological data, enabling dynamic brain-state-dependent experiments.

Key Features
Real-Time Theta Detection: Online analysis of LFP to detect theta oscillations.

Closed-Loop Control: Automated system responses (e.g., stimulation, recording triggers) tied to theta power thresholds.
